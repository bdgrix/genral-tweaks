### 🔴 **Important Notes:**

**Using a custom OS is optional** but highly recommended depending on the tasks you do on your PC and which games you play. If you're a serious gamer or power user, **Windows X-Lite** can provide **better performance** and a smoother experience. 🖥️⚡

This will optimize your system and give you that **smooth performance** you need for games like **Fortnite**. Get ready to **dominate** and flex your skills with **zero latency** and **high FPS**! 😎🔥
